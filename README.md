Records some note of my study journey.

## Commit Message

Commit message should follow **<scope\>: <subject\>**.

*<scope\>* A word to specify place of the commit change.
- use controller or component name
- changes in folder `/docs` should use `docs` as scope
- changes in API test should use `test` as scope **NOT** `apiTest` or others
- don't capitalize first letter
- **bug** is not a scope, so there never should appear commit message like `bug: fix ...` in our repo.

*<subject\>* This is a very short description of the change.
- use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
- don't capitalize first letter
- no dot (.) at the end
